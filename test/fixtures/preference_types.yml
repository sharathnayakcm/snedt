# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
  name: Delete Stream Message
  description: While deleting a stream do not show the pop message
two: {}
#  column: value
